# Hi there, I'm MarÃ­a JosÃ©! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Scientist based in Switzerland.  I finished my PhD in Computer Science in May 2022, with a strong technical focus on Big Data preprocessing using technologies such as Spark, Scala, and Python, and applying Machine Learning algorithms for data classification.

I thrive in collaborative environments, both sharing my skills and embracing new ones.

I'm currently participating as a Data Science Lead in the [deploy(impact) volunteer program](https://www.womenplusplus.ch/deploy-impact), upskilling about Natural Language Processing (NLP).

I'm looking to collaborate on projects for social good by leveraging my skills.
